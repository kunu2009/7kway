1. **Dopamine Dysregulation** - Fapping/scrolling gives instant dopamine, studying doesn't
2. **Task Overwhelm** - "Study for boards" is too vague, brain freezes
3. **No Immediate Pain** - Consequences are months away, brain ignores
4. **Decision Fatigue** - Too many choices = no choice made
5. **Perfectionism** - "I'll start when conditions are perfect" (they never are)

## 🔥 MOTIVATION & MINDSET

### Your Situation is Your Advantage

```
"I am ugly, darkish skin tone, short 5'4 ft, weight 49.9 kg, 
I am dumb, I procrastinate, I am poor, one room chawl..."
```

**Reframe:**
- Ugly → Transform through physique, skincare, grooming
- Dark skin → Clear, healthy skin is attractive on ANY tone
- Short → You have 1-3 years to maximize height
- Skinny → Perfect base for muscle building (no cutting needed)
- "Dumb" → You're building AI apps, you're NOT dumb
- Procrastinator → You're building an app to FIX this
- Poor → Hungry for success, no comfort zone to lose
- Chawl → Goggins grew up worse, now he's a legend

### The Reality

At 16, with 7 years of monk mode:
- You WILL be 5'9"-5'10" with perfect protocol
- You WILL have a shredded physique
- You WILL be a corporate lawyer
- You WILL build the 7K empire
- You WILL be unrecognizable from current self

### Daily Affirmations (Add to App)

```
"I am disciplined. I take action even when I don't feel like it."
"My circumstances don't define me. My actions do."
"Every day I am becoming the best version of myself."
"I am building something great. 7K is my legacy."
"I don't wait for motivation. I create it through action."
```

### Role Models to Study

- **David Goggins** - From nothing to elite
- **Andrew Huberman** - Science-based optimization
- **Alex Hormozi** - Business from zero
- **Indian Lawyers** - Harish Salve, Fali Nariman
